# WaterTracker

WaterTracker is a web application that allows users to track their daily water intake, keeping track of their water portions throughout the day. The application includes a feature to calculate the daily water intake requirement based on the user's gender, weight, and hours of activity. Users can also manually set their daily water intake goal.

# Features

1. Customizable Daily Norm: Users have the option to calculate their recommended daily water intake based on factors such as gender, weight, and activity level, or manually input their desired daily goal.

2. Water Intake Tracking: Users can monitor the amount of water consumed each day by adding portions throughout the day. They can also edit portions if necessary.

3. Crossbar Indicator: A special crossbar displays the percentage of water consumed for the day relative to the daily intake goal.

4. Monthly Statistics: Users can view their water intake statistics for each day of the month, presented as percentages, in a calendar view.

5. User Profile Editing: The application allows users to edit their profile information, including their name, password, and avatar.
